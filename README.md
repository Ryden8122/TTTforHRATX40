## Notes and Research of on the humbe Tic-Tac-Toe game

How do things work around here?

  psuedo-whiteboarding!

  How can we create an HTML/JS/CSS Tic-tac-toe game?
  How is it structure?

  What's the flow of the gameplay?
    How does the game start?
    How does the game end?
      What is the win condition?

  How are things handled?
    When a square is clicked it should draw a circle
      The opposite is true for Xs
    How do we know whose turn it is? X or O

    What is the win condition?
      When you can strike through 3 of a kind
      Othewise it's a CAT game


	Answering how should be the board be structure?
	Xs and Os should be contained in a `<div>`
	within that `<div>` should contain arrays of divs.
	
	Essentially a matrix!
